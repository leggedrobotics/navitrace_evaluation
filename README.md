# NaviTrace Evaluation

This repository contains example code on how to evaluate models on our benchmark [NaviTrace](https://leggedrobotics.github.io/navitrace_webpage/), including model inference via API and the score calculation.
The benchmark consists of a validation split and a test split with hidden ground-truths.
If you want to see how your model scores on the test set or want to submit your model to the leaderboard, check out this [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/leggedrobotics/navitrace_leaderboard).
